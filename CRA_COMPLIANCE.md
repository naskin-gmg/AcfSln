#### 3.3 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

ACF-Solutions main dependencies:

**Runtime Dependencies:**
- ACF (Application Component Framework) - ImagingTools GmbH (LGPL-2.1)
- Qt Framework (version 5.x/6.x) - Qt Project (LGPL/GPL)
- Standard C++ library (implementation-dependent)

**Build Dependencies:**
- CMake 3.x or later (BSD License)
- QMake (part of Qt)
- Doxygen (GPL) - for documentation generation

SBOM can be generated using standard tools:
- For CMake builds: Use `cmake --graphviz` or SBOM generation tools
- For package distributions: Use platform-specific SBOM tools

#### 3.4 Open Source Compliance

- Full source code available: https://github.com/ImagingTools/AcfSln
- License: LGPL-2.1 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE))
- Dependencies are clearly documented
- Build from source instructions provided

### 4. Support and Maintenance (Article 14)

#### 4.1 Support Period

- **Current Release**: Full support including security updates
- **Previous Release**: Security updates for critical issues
- **Older Releases**: Community support, no official security updates

#### 4.2 End of Support

- When a version reaches end of support, it will be announced in:
  - GitHub releases
  - Repository README
  - Project documentation
  - Minimum 6 months notice for planned end of support

#### 4.3 Maintenance Activities

- Bug fixes and security patches
- Compatibility updates for dependencies
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations

### 5. Conformity Assessment

#### 5.1 Self-Assessment

As an open-source software toolkit under LGPL-2.1:

- ACF-Solutions provides building blocks for applications
- End-product manufacturers are responsible for their own CRA compliance
- ACF-Solutions maintains documentation to support downstream compliance
- Security practices align with CRA requirements

#### 5.2 Third-Party Dependencies

Users must ensure compliance for:

- ACF (Application Component Framework) from ImagingTools
- Qt Framework (from Qt Project)
- Platform-specific system libraries
- Any additional dependencies added by downstream users

#### 5.3 Risk Assessment

ACF-Solutions is designed as a toolkit with:

- **Low inherent risk**: Toolkit provides tools, doesn't handle sensitive data directly
- **User responsibility**: Applications built with ACF-Solutions must implement their own security controls
- **Extensibility considerations**: Users must review security of custom components

### 6. Incident Response

#### 6.1 Security Incident Handling

In case of a security incident:

1. **Detection**: Through reports or automated scanning
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Communication**: Notify affected users via GitHub advisories
4. **Remediation**: Develop and release fix
5. **Disclosure**: Publish advisory after fix is available

#### 6.2 Communication Channels

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Project documentation updates
- Direct notification to known affected users when possible

### 7. Documentation and Records

#### 7.1 Available Documentation

- Security policy: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- License information: [LICENSE](LICENSE)
- Build instructions in documentation
- Component usage examples

#### 7.2 Change Management
